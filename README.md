# Analysis of Health Cost Information - Intro to Data Science (Technology used: R)

## Overview
This project analyzes health cost information for individuals, focusing on the impact of various attributes such as age, BMI, physical exercise, smoking habits, marital status, location, and education level on medical expenses. The analysis aims to provide insights for Health Management Organizations (HMOs) to lower the medical costs of their clients and suggest business policies.

## Key Features
* **Identification of key attributes:** Analyzed how age, BMI, smoking status, exercise habits, marital status, and other factors influence medical expenses.
* **Predictive modeling:** Developed models such as Linear Regression, Support Vector Machines, and Association Rules Mining to predict medical costs.
* **Interactive visualization:** Created a Shiny Web app to visualize analysis results, making it easier for stakeholders to understand and act on the insights.

## Methodology
* **Data cleaning and preprocessing:** Utilized R programming for data cleaning and preprocessing, including handling missing values and transforming variables.
* **Data analysis:** Employed advanced statistical modeling techniques, including Linear Regression and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
* **Visualization:** Developed interactive visualizations using the Shiny Web app to communicate results effectively.
* **Tools used:** R, Shiny, ggplot2, caret, e1071, and other R packages for data analysis and visualization.

## Key Findings
* **Impact of smoking:** Smokers have significantly higher medical expenses compared to non-smokers.
* **BMI and medical costs:** Higher BMI is positively correlated with increased medical expenses.
* **Exercise habits:** Regular physical exercise is associated with lower medical costs.
* **Marital status and health costs:** Married individuals generally incur lower medical expenses than unmarried individuals.
* **Predictive accuracy:** Achieved an 87.8% accuracy in predicting medical expense categories using the KSVM model.

## Conclusion
The analysis provides valuable insights into the factors affecting medical expenses, enabling HMOs to make data-driven decisions to reduce costs and improve healthcare outcomes. The interactive Shiny Web app facilitates the communication of these insights to stakeholders, promoting informed decision-making.
